## CURRENT VERSION ##

Version 0.5.2 (released May 23, 2021)

## Contents (updated as project continues) ##

- M1_0 - A folder containing our code for Milestone 1. (Please refer below for understanding where the code is stored).

- M2_0 - A folder containing our code for Milestone 2. We used a separate folder so we could track our changes and make it easier for our tutor to find the code for the features of this Milestone. This also includes unit testing however we will also be creating a separate git branch with the unit tests for easier access.

## Navigating Folders ##

Because of the framework we used, the code is split throughout various folders within the M1.0 (Milestone 1) and upcoming Milestone 2 folders.

"application/config/database.php" - Database configuration file

"application/controllers" - Controller classes for program (C in MVC)

"application/models" - Model classes for the program (M in MVC)

"application/views" - Webpages for the program (view files. V in MVC)

"assets" - CSS files

## Running Code ##

If you need to run the code and interact with the web page, you'll need some sort of way to view PHP files. You'll need a local web host server. MAMP for Mac or XAMPP for Windows are good examples.

Keep in mind, to interact with the web page and have it functioning properly you'll need the database which will hold the login and registration data, movie data, feedback, etc.
